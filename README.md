# Personal Management Tool ðŸš€

As part of my new infrastructure concept, I decided to finally start the development of a 
universal tool that provides different solutions to the user such as an encrypted password
manager, a tool to keep track of your to-do's and the main feature, a system to keep track
of your financial management.

#### My Reason for this project
First, I want to improve myself in the development process of a bigger project. For this
reason, I am really happy about any criticism on my way to code, present my updates, keeping
my repository and more. âš  **Please tell me anything you think that can be improved.** 

The second reason is that I already have the main feature of the system (the financial tracking)
kind of implemented in excel, but I believe that a standalone system, which can be customized
for different people is much more efficient and also an interesting project to realize.



## Features
These are the main features that are "up and running" at the current moment.

- Basic layout and routing system
- User Authentication
- Password Manager (Creating passwords, Managing them [Delete, Rename], Encryption & Decryption on client-side)
- Universal fuzzy-search (Searching for pages and more later on...)
