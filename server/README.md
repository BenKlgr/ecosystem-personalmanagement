### Welcome! 👋

This system is part of my new ecosystem 🚀that I build for my website benklingeler.de and projects that are coming in the future. My main goal 🎖️ is to develop an environment with dynamic systems, which are all using centralized functions, such as user authentication, server management, data flow and more.

##### About this system

The Identity Server does what the name says. Users can authenticate with this system across different other platforms, that I will provide in the future. The benefits of a system like this are:

- Users don`t have to sign up for every single system again. Which saves time⌛
- Some data from users can be shared through the whole ecosystem, which makes it more efficient.
- The development process of the authentication system is dramatically reduced.
